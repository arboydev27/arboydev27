# üí´ About Me:

Hi there!<br><br>
üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on a startup that combines Blockchain and AI to make bureaucratic processes more efficient and transparent, think permits, licenses, and government workflows that currently take weeks (or months). My passion for this stems from firsthand experience with how inefficient systems can hold people back. I‚Äôm driven to build tech that empowers everyday citizens, simplifies access, and promotes transparency where it's needed most. This project reflects my belief that technology should work for people, not the other way around.<br><br>ü§ù I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on meaningful projects focused on civic tech, AI for good, or anything that solves real-world problems. If you're working on tools that support underserved communities or improve digital access to public services, I‚Äôd love to connect and build with you.<br><br>üß† I‚Äôm looking for help with designing robust backend systems, understanding regulatory frameworks for startups, and optimizing AI models for performance and affordability. I'm especially curious about how to balance innovation with security and compliance in public-facing applications.<br><br>üå± I‚Äôm currently learning about smart contract vulnerabilities in relation to the blockchain technology, full-stack web development (Next.js + Tailwind CSS), and how to build AI tools that are both powerful and ethical. I‚Äôm also exploring how different companies and governments are integrating technology to drive development and better serve normal people.<br><br>üí¨ Ask me about my work teaching youth to code, running tech workshops, or designing AI-driven educational tools. I love talking about how we can use technology to make education and innovation more accessible.<br><br>‚ö° Fun fact: I once built a super simple Arduino-based wearable device in under one hour, just to have something for the Young Scientists Tanzania 2019 competition. What started out as a quick idea actually won first place in the national tech category. The reason? I focused on solving a niche problem and explained its real-world use case better than others who had been developing their projects for months. Sometimes, creativity and clarity beat complexity and that one spontaneous hour taught me that big wins can come from bold, scrappy moves.
